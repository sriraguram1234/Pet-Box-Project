I changed product_id from integer to string and re_buy from integer to binary. I realized that the data in the sales column was separated by commas, So that I validated and changed the data type from string to integer.Column pet_type has 6 types , Based on the requirement , I removed to type named hamster and rabbit.\n\n","metadata":{"tags":[]},"id":"d1b1a012-1ccb-40e7-a1ad-77b60b256690","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":" Finally the Dataset was ready for Analysis.\n- There were no blank cells.\n- Pet type only has 4 variables,they were dog,cat,fish,bird.\n- Data types of product_id,Vendor_id were changed to string.\n- Sales column was validated and converted to integer.\n- re_buy column changed from integer to Binary.","metadata":{},"id":"f8240f3a-0755-46de-bbc5-ab51138bf4bb","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Data Discovery and Visualization\nLets see about the insights from data visuaization.\n\n### **1.
